    "# Repartitioning DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitions are a central concept in Apache Spark. They are used for distributing and parallelizing work onto different executors, which run on multiple servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining Partitions\n",
    "Basically Spark uses two different strategies for splitting up data into multiple partitions:\n",
    "1. When Spark loads data, the records are put into partitions along natural borders. For example every HDFS block (and thereby every file) is represented by a different partition. Therefore the number of partitions of a DataFrame read from disk is solely determined by the number of HDFS blocks\n",
    "2. Certain operations like `JOIN`s and aggregations require that records with the same key are physically in the same partition. This is achieved by a shuffle phase. The number of partitions is specified by the global Spark configuration variable `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` which has a default value of 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repartitiong Data\n",
    "Since partitions have a huge influence on the execution, Spark also allows you to explicitly change the partitioning schema of a DataFrame. This makes sense only in a very limited (but still important) set of cases, which we will discuss in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Example\n",
    "Surprise, surprise, we will again use the weather example and see what explicit repartitioning gives us."

Per design Spark writes each partition into a separate file, and there is no way around that.

Specifically currently HDFS is not designed to handle many small files, but prefers fewer large files instead.\n",

You could perform this task by a `repartition` operation, but this is an expensive operation requiring an additional shuffle operation. Therefore Spark provides an additional method called `coalesce` which can be used to reduce the number of partitions without incurring an additional shuffle. Spark simply logically concatenates multiple partitions into new partitions."
