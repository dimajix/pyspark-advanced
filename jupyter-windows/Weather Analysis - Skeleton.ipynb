    "```\n",
    "    AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(columns) OVER(window_specification)\n",
    "```\n",

    "    PARTITION BY category\n",
    "    ORDER BY ordering_column [ASC|DESC]\n",
    "    RANGE BETWEEN start PRECEEDING AND end FOLLOWING\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PARTITION BY` works similar to a `GROUP BY` operation. It controls which rows will be in the same partition with the given row. Also, the user might want to make sure all rows having the same value for  the category column are collected to the same machine before ordering and calculating the frame.  If no partitioning specification is given, then all data must be collected to a single machine. - it filters records which are used for creating each window\n",
    "* `ORDER BY` sorts all records of a single window accordingly. It controls the way that rows in a partition are ordered, determining the position of the given row in its partition.\n",
    "* `RANGE BETWEEN` states which rows will be included in the frame for the current input row, based on their relative position to the current row.  For example, “the three rows preceding the current row to the current row” describes a frame including the current input row and three rows appearing before the current row.\n",
