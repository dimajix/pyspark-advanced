    "# Execution Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we try to understand Spark execution plans. We will use the weather example and analyse all the steps in order to get a better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exeuction Model of Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to many other (mainly non-distributed) frameworks, Spark does not execute any transformation immediately, but only records the step and builds a so called execution plan. This plan is the basis for Sparks resilience against failure of individual nodes (since the result can be reconstructed from the execution plan), but also allows Spark to perform optimizations which span all transformation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically with Spark DataFrames (as opposed to the more low level RDD interface), Spark uses an advanced optimizer. The general steps of query processing in response to an action (like a \"show\" or \"save\" action)\" are always as follows:\n",
    "1. Parse logical execution plan\n",
    "2. Analyze logical execution plan and resolve all symbols (tables, columns, functions)\n",
    "3. Optimize logical execution plan\n",
    "4. Create physical execution plan by mapping all steps to RDD operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation to RDDs\n",
    "Note that RDDs are only used in the very last step, although the general conception is that DataFrames sit on top of RDDs. But the point is, that a DataFrame first collects all transformations on a higher level of abstraction and RDDs only come into play in this very last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually you can access an RDD of any DataFrame. BUT: This access will actually create the physical execution plan for this specific RDD. Before accessing this RDD it even didn't exist. This also means that using a DataFrames RDD actually is an optimization barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weather Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following steps, we will try to understand how Spark executes a simplified version of the weather analysis including aggregations and joins."
