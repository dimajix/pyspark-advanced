    "# SQL Common Table Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "SQl is a very powerful language that allows the construction of very complex queries. But SQL only provides very limited support for structuting query in order to increase readability. So called \"Common Table Expressions\" (CTEs) are a common way to split up large SQL queries into smaller and more manageable chunks. This approach works with all SQL databases, not only with Spark SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention!** In Spark, CTEs will be optimized away, such that there is no difference in execution speed. Different (relational) databases might handle CTEs differently and they might represent an optimization barrier. Please consult the manual of your database before blindlingly using CTEs!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will pick up the weather example and use Spark SQL to calculate some aggregates per year and country. We will not provide the most efficient implementation in order to make the whole structure more complicated to show the power of common table expressions."
