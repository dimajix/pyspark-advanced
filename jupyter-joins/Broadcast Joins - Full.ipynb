    "# Broadcast Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining two (or more) data sources is an important and elementary operation in an relation algebra, like Spark. But actually the implementation is not trivial, especially for distributed systems like Spark. The main challenge is to physically bring together all records that need to be joined from both data sources onto a single machine, otherwise they cannot be merged. This means that data needs to be exchanged over the network, which is complex and slower than local access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the size of the DataFrames to be joined, different strategies can be used. Spark supports two different join implementations:\n",
    "* Shuffle join - will shuffle both DataFrames over the network to ensure that matching records end up on the same machine\n",
    "* Broadcast join - will provide a copy of one DataFrames to all machines of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "While shuffle joins can work with arbitrary large data sets, a broadcast join always requires that the broadcast DataFrame completely fits into memory on all machines. But it can be much faster when the DataFrame is small enoguh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we will investigate into the different join types with our weather example."

The stations metadata DataFrame is now broadcast to all worker nodes (still a network operation), but the measurement DataFrame does not require any repartitioning or shuffling any more. The broadcast join operation now is executed in three steps:\n",
    "* Filter `NULL` values again\n",
    "* Broadcast station metadata to all Spark executors\n",
    "* Perform `BroadcastHashJoin`\n",
    "\n",
    "A broadcast operation often makes sense in similar cases where you have large fact tables (measurements, purchase orders etc) and smaller lookup tables."

This mechanism works fine when reading data from disk, but will not work after non-trivial transformations like `JOIN`s or grouped aggregations. In these cases Spark has no idea how large the results will be, but the execution plan has to be fixed before the first transformation is executed. In these cases (if by domain knowledge) you know that certain DataFrames will be small, an explicit `broadcast()` will still help."
